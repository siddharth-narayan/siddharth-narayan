## Hello!
Hi! I'm Siddharth - I enjoy working on challenging problems, especially ones involving performance, system design, and infrastructure. I value clean, understandable code, stability, reproducibilty, and well designed systems.
I have a wide area of skills and understanding, from frontend and backend, to server management, networking and devOps.



## Experience
I have experience in many languages, with a lot of langauages, frameworks, and services, most of which are small projects not worth putting on Github. If you don't see it here, there's still a good chance I have experience with it! I'll just list a couple technologies you won't see much of here but that I have significant experience in.

- NginX
- Java
- Docker
- Linux / Server Management
- DevOps with Nix
- Reverse Engineering with Ghidra
